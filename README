MHI
---

mhi is a comamndline style mailread in the tradition of mh and
nmh, but mutated to support IMAP.  

Why?

One thing that IMAP provides is the ability for multiple clients
to access the same mail store.  Graphical clients are all well
and good, but sometimes a reversion to the commandline is necessary.
Neither mh nor nmh will talk to an IMAP server, so I had to write my 
own client.  Python's imaplib made this easy.
